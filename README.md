# Blood-Donation-portal
Blood Donation Portal This project is a web-based Blood Donation Portal designed to streamline the process of finding and coordinating blood donors. It features a user-friendly interface with a sliding menu bar, allowing users to update their profiles and access various sections, such as "Why We Need to Donate Blood" and "Rules to Donate Blood."


# Key functionalities include:

Donate Blood: Users can request blood donations by specifying location, address, and required quantity. The status of each request (applied, accepted, or denied) is displayed directly on the portal.
See the List of Blood Group Holders: Displays potential donors from the local area based on blood groups, allowing users to send donation requests and view detailed donor profiles.
Profile Management: Donor information is stored locally and includes personal and contact details, health conditions, last donation date, and more.
Email Notifications: Integrated with server.js, the portal sends acceptance emails to donors when a blood request is approved.
Interactive Dialogs: Uses dialog boxes for user inputs instead of traditional alerts or prompts, ensuring a smooth user experience.
